This is a scraper that runs on [Morph](https://morph.io).
The scraper automatically grabs mcc/mnc data from wikipedia once per day.
You can download the data from [here](https://morph.io/vladimirgamalian/wiki_mcc_mnc).

Also, there is a little python script for grab the data from wikipedia and save it in json format. See the [gist](https://gist.github.com/vladimirgamalian/f30264f0fbda5d6d9171).
